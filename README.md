# WeatherPy_Page
This is my Web Visualization Homework. It visualizes the results of my WeatherPy homework. 


As usual, many thanks to my tutor, Brent Hillen. This week, he helped me get my nav bar working correctly.

Additional kudos to Andy Lindburgh, who showed me how to make edits across all of my files simultaneously and figured out why one of my displays was incorrect. 

Finally, I am grateful for the insight of Julia Smith, who helped me with my media queries.
